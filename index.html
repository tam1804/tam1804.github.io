ce, may also use cookies or other technologies, and those practices and pro=
viders are subject to their own policies.</p>

about use of this Service. Google Analytics collects information such as ho=
w often users visit this Site, what pages they visit when they do so, and w=
hat other sites they used prior to coming to this Site. NHATLONGNA uses the in=
formation it gets from Google Analytics to understand Service usage and pat=

ress assigned to you on the date you visit a Service, rather than your name=

dentify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Service, the cookie =
cannot be used by anyone but Google.</p>

time of collection and you may elect not to participate in the service or p=
romotion.</p>

legal or regulatory obligations; as requested by law enforcement or other g=
overnment officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellect=
ual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose=
 you or us to legal liability; or as NHATLONGNA otherwise deems necessary to d=
etect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, technical issues, or =
other threats to NHATLONGNA or others.</p>

 services on our behalf, including payment processing, order fulfillment, d=
ata analysis, marketing services, email campaigns, hosting services, and cu=
stomer service. While providing the services for us, these companies may ac=
cess your personal information, and are required to use it solely as direct=

ird party to assist us in providing you with our Service. We will share the=
 information you provide us through your social network, such as (1) your f=

tification number of the pertinent social network, which is linked to publi=
cly available information such as name and profile picture; (4) the login e=

king technologies like cookies and web beacons. The information collected m=

			<h2>Your rights and choices in relation to your personal information</h2=
>

			<p>Accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal information</p>

In that sense, upon providing sufficient identification (to protect others'=

ted.
			In certain territories (including the EU), you also have a legal right t=
o ask for a restriction of processing, to object to processing as well as t=
he right to data portability. However, these rights are subject to conditio=
ns and may not always be applicable.</p>

ntained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days =
for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails abou=

 from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the de=
vice level through your settings.</p>

			<h3>Behavioral advertising</h3>

			<p>Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad network=
s. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Cons=
umer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based adverti=
sing and your choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. Y=
ou may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-O=

 choices regarding having information used by NAI members. Additional infor=
mation is available on the DAA's website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI's =

			<p>Users in the European Union may go the European Interactive Digital A=
dvertising Alliance ("EDAA") Your Online Choices website and select their c=
ountry to learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt out in=
 their own country. For example, users in France may go to the Controler se=
s cookieswebsite to opt out of certain third-party ad networks' interest-ba=
sed advertising and find additional information at www.youronlinechoices.co=
m/fr.</p>

			<p>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choi=
ce Page, the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or through the various EDAA website=
s will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content=
 or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any adverti=
sing through our Site or App or on other websites. You may continue to rece=
ive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you a=
re viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). If your browser is configured to=

			<h2>Policy regarding children under the age of 13</h2>

			<p>The NHATLONGNA is committed to protecting the privacy of children who us=
e our sites and applications. This Children's Online Privacy Policy explain=
s our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices wi=
th respect to information provided by children under the age of 13 ("child"=
 or "children"), and uses terms that are defined in our general PRIVACY AND=
 COOKIE POLICY. This policy is in accordance with the U.S. Children's Onlin=
e Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), and outlines our practices in the Unite=
d States and Latin America regarding children's personal information. For m=
ore information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children's on=
line privacy, please visit OnGuard Online. Most of NHATLONGNA's Services are f=
or kids audience and are directed to children under the age of 13. Through =
these Services, NHATLONGNA does not knowingly collect or solicit personal info=
rmation from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to =
access those Services.</p>

			<p>Through other Services, however, NHATLONGNA may be more likely to collec=
t some personal information about children under 13. For such Services, DEV=
GAME will request users' ages and, if a user indicates that s/he is under 1=
3, NHATLONGNA will only collect personal information, such as persistent ident=
ifiers (e.g., IP address and device information), necessary for internal op=
erations of the Service. NHATLONGNA will only use such information to support =
internal operations of the Service and not for other purposes.</p>

			<p>If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register an account wit=
h any of the Services or send any information about yourself to us, includi=
ng your name, address, telephone number, or email address. In the event tha=
t we learn that we have collected personal information other than persisten=
t identifiers used to support internal operations of the Services, from a c=
hild under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as pos=
sible. We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents or gua=
rdians for permission before sending any information about themselves to an=
yone over the Internet.</p>

			<h2>1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM CHILDREN, HOW WE USE IT, AND HOW =
AND WHEN WE COMMUNICATE WITH PARENTS</h2>

			<p>NHATLONGNA offers to its users a range of sites and applications, some o=
f which are primarily targeted at children, and others that are intended fo=
r users of all ages and their families. Our sites and applications offer a =
variety of activities, including activities that may collect information fr=
om children. Below we summarize potential instances of collection and outli=
ne how and when we will provide parental notice and/or seek parental consen=
t. In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we wi=
ll retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill =
the activity request or allow the child to continue to participate in the a=
ctivity, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as requi=
red by law. In the event we discover we have collected information from a c=
hild in a manner inconsistent with COPPA's requirements, we will either del=
ete the information or immediately seek the parent's consent for that colle=
ction.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Registration</h3>

			<p>Children can, in many cases, register with our sites and applications=
 to view content, play games, participate in contests, and engage in specia=
l features, among other things. During the registration process, we may ask=
 the child to provide certain information for notification and security pur=
poses, including a parent or guardian's email address, the child's first na=
me and gender, the child's member or account username, and password. We als=
o may ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages. We strongly=
 advise children never to provide any personal information in their usernam=
es. Please note that children can choose whether to share their information=
 with us, but certain features cannot function without it. As a result, chi=
ldren may not be able to access certain features if required information ha=
s not been provided. We will not require a child to provide more informatio=
n than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activit=
y.</p>

			<p>About the collection of parent email address: Consistent with the req=
uirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any in=
stance where we ask for age and determine the user is age 12 or under, we w=
ill ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect any person=
al information from the child. If you believe your child is participating i=
n an activity that collects personal information and you or another parent/=
guardian have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consen=
t, please feel free to contact us at support@NHATLONGNAou.com. We will not use=
 parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the pare=
nt, unless the parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has sepa=
rately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Content Generated by a Child</h3>

			<p>Certain activities on our sites and applications allow children to cr=
eate or manipulate content and save it with NHATLONGNA. Some of these activiti=
es do not require children to provide any personal information and therefor=
e may not result in notice to the parent or require parental consent. If an=
 activity potentially allows a child to insert personal information in thei=
r created content, we will either pre-screen the submission to delete any p=
ersonal information, or we will seek verifiable parental consent by email f=
or the collection. Examples of created content that may include personal in=
formation are stories or other open-text fields, and drawings that allow te=
xt or free-hand entry of information. If, in addition to collecting content=
 that includes personal information, NHATLONGNA also plans to post the content=
 publicly or share it with a third party for the third party's own use, we =
will obtain a higher level of parental consent.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>About Verifiable Parental Consent:</h3>

			<p>Email Consent. In the event NHATLONGNA wishes to collect personal inform=
ation from a child, COPPA requires that we first seek a parent or guardian'=
s consent by email. In the email we will explain what information we are co=
llecting, how we plan to use it, how the parent can provide consent, and ho=
w the parent can revoke consent. If we do not receive parental consent with=
in a reasonable time, we will delete the parent contact information and any=
 other information collected from the child in connection with that activit=
y.</p>

			<p>High-Level Consent. In the event NHATLONGNA collects personal informatio=
n from a child that will be posted publicly, we will seek a higher level of=
 consent than email consent. Such "high-level" methods of consent include b=
ut are not limited to asking for a credit card or other payment method for =
verification (with a nominal charge involved), speaking to a trained custom=
er service representative by telephone or video chat, or requiring a signed=
 consent form by mail, email attachment, or fax. After providing high-level=
 consent, a parent may have the opportunity to use a pin or password in fut=
ure communications as a way to confirm the parent's identity.</p>

			<p>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent. With regard to school-based acti=
vities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead=
 of parents to provide consent for the collection of personal information f=
rom children. Schools should always notify parents about these activities. =
For more information on parental rights with respect to a child's education=
al record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), plea=
se visit the FERPA site.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Chat</h3>

			<p>Certain games and activities that are directed to children allow user=
s to communicate directly with other users by means of a chat system. In mo=
st cases, these chat systems employ filters that are intended to prevent th=
e communication of both personal information and age-inappropriate words an=
d phrases. In addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or enc=
ourage other users to flag inappropriate communications. We strongly encour=
age children who use these interactive features on our sites and applicatio=
ns never to provide personal information about themselves or any third part=
y, and certainly never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation. =
We also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the =
children participate in online activities.</p>

			<p>Where NHATLONGNA employs a chat system that does not filter all or nearl=
y all personal information, we will first seek high-level consent from the =
parent.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Contests and Sweepstakes</h3>

			<p>For contests and sweepstakes, we typically require only the informati=
on necessary for a child to participate, such as first name (to distinguish=
 among family members) and parent email address (to notify the parent where=
 required by law). We only contact the parent for more personalized informa=
tion for prize-fulfillment purposes when the child wins the contest or swee=
pstakes.</p>

			<p>Of course, some contests and sweepstakes ask the child to submit thei=
r own created content along with the child's entry. In those instances, we =
may require parental consent prior to submission.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Email Contact with a Child</h3>

			<p>On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a chil=
d, NHATLONGNA may need to ask for the child's online contact information, such=
 as an email address. NHATLONGNA will delete this information immediately afte=
r responding to the question or request.</p>

			<p>In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a c=
hild's online contact information, such as an email address, in order to co=
mmunicate with the child more than once. In such instances we will retain t=
he child's online contact information to honor the request and for no other=
 purpose such as marketing. One example would be a newsletter that provides=
 occasional updates about a site, game/activity, television show, personali=
ty/character, or feature movie. Whenever we collect a child's online contac=
t information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a =
parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and=
 use of the child's information, as well as to provide the parent an opport=
unity to prevent further contact with the child. On some occasions a child =
may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be =
required to "opt-out" of each communication individually.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Push Notifications</h3>

			<p>Push notifications are notifications on mobile and other devices that=
 are typically associated with downloaded applications, and which can commu=
nicate to the device holder even when the application is not in use. We wil=
l require a child to provide a parent email address before the child can re=
ceive push notifications from our child-directed applications that collect =
a device identifier. We will then provide the parent with notice of our con=
tact with the child and will provide the parent the opportunity to prevent =
further notifications. Finally, we will not associate the device identifier=
 with other personal information without contacting the parent to get conse=
nt.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Geolocation Data</h3>

			<p>If a child-directed NHATLONGNA site or application collects geolocation =
information that is specific enough to equate to the collection of a street=
 address, we will first seek parental consent via email.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>Persistent Identifiers</h3>

			<p>When children interact with us, certain information may automatically=
 be collected, both to make our sites and applications more interesting and=
 useful to children and for various purposes related to our business. Examp=
les include the type of computer operating system, the child's IP address o=
r mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the c=
hild visits various parts of our sites or applications, and information reg=
arding the online or mobile service provider. This information is collected=
 using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other =
unique identifiers. This information may be collected by NHATLONGNA or by a th=
ird party. This data is principally used for internal purposes only, in ord=
er to:</p>
			<ul><li>provide children with access to features and activities on our s=
ites and applications</li>
			<li>customize content and improve our sites and applications</li>
			<li>conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our site=
s and applications</li>
			<li>generate anonymous reporting for use by NHATLONGNA</li></ul>
			<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our sites and applications for other purposes, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p>

			<h2>2. WHEN INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN IS AVAILABLE TO OTHERS</h2>

			<p>In addition to those rare instances where a child's personal information is posted publicly (after receiving high-level parental consent), we al=
so may share or disclose personal information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:
			</p><ul><li>We may share information with our service providers if necessary for them to perform a business, professional, or technology support function for us.</li>
			<li>We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personal information collec=
ted from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency's (including schools or children services) request; (ii) if we believe disclos=
ure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our sites or applications; (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, appli=
cations, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability</li></ul>

			<h2>3. PARENTAL CHOICES AND CONTROLS</h2>

			<p>At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the personal informationwe have collected in connection with that account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.</p>

			<p>Where a child has registered for a NHATLONGNA account, we use one methodto allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children: Parents can contactus to request access to, change, or delete their child's personal information by sending an email to us at laptrinhchocon@gmail.com A valid request to d=
elete personal information will be accommodated within a reasonable time.</p>
